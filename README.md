##Github profile

This project is from the week 8 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
This challenge introduces Angular to us. The tutorial included the same app but
written in Javascript first so that we can appreciate what Angular can do. It
took me a while to fully understand how it works and appreciate the two way
binding model.

##Challenges

Mocking the search factory was quite difficult and I still don't really
understand how it works. Otherwise, even though it's an entirely new technology,
it was ok on the whole.

##Technologies used

Angular JS, Sinatra

Protractor, Karma

##How to install

Clone the repo and run open public/index.html to run the app.

Run karma start test/karma.conf.js to start the Karma tests. Run
webdriver-manager start, http-server, and then protractor test/e2e/conf.js to
run the Protractor tests.
